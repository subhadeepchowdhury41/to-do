# Frontend

The frontend is built using React, TypeScript, and Material-UI (MUI). The app is a simple todo list that allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) todos.

## How to run the server

To run the server, navigate to the frontend directory and run the following command:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```
